## General info
My group of friends and I enjoy the occasional whisky tasting night. For one such evening we decided it would be fun if everyone brought an unopend bottle of whisky representing the different Scottish whisky regions. We decided that we would randomly assign everyone a different region to bring a bottle of whisky from and that since there were more people coming than official whisy regions, we would have the extra bottle assignments weighed by how many different distilleries were in each region.

This application will randomly assign each attendee a Scotch whisky region to bring a bottle from.
