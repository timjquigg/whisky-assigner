## General info
My group of friends and I enjoy the occasional whisky tasting night. For one such evening we decided it would be fun if everyone brought an unopend bottle of whisky representing the different Scottish whisky regions. We decided that we would randomly assign everyone a different region to bring a bottle of whisky from and that since there were more people coming than official whisy regions, we would have the extra bottle assignments weighed by how many different distilleries were in each region.

This application will randomly assign each attendee a Scotch whisky region to bring a bottle from, a snack to bring, and a draw number.

## Technologies
* node.js - version 12.14.1
* Visual Studio Code - version 1.52.1

## Setup
Currently this can be run from the command line using node.js. In future I may incorporate a web interface.

## Features
Current features of this program
* Randomly assign each guest a whisky region to bring a bottle of whisky from. This program will make sure each region is represented before doubling up. When duplicates are allowed it will then use a weighting system based on how many distilleries are in each region.
* Randomly assign each guest a snack to bring. Similar to the whisky regions, this will make sure the different snacks are represented before duplication.
* Randomly assign a draw number. At the end of the whisky tasting, each guest selects a bottle from the night to bring home. The order of selection is determined randomly.

To-do list:
* Develop web interface for whisky night.
* Allow for guest signup on website
